# Tick-Tack-Toe-game
In this Project I created a game which is called Tick Tack Toe. And this game is like which we played in our childhood and its name in Hindi is (Zero-Kata) (X,0). And it is a 2 player game in which players will decide whom will take X , 0  and whom player meets three X or three 0 player will win the game.
There are 3 conditions in this game:
•	if three x meet player 1 will win the who choose X
•	if three 0 meet player 2 will win the who choose 0
•	Else game will Draw

This game is created by using Core Java and Android Studio
